---Magic Items---

--Signals--
-EnergyChanged(amount:float) -> emitted anytime a magic items energy value changes
-EnergyOut -> energy has run out
-----------

--Methods--
-Set Data() -> sets the MagicItemData for an object if the items is predetermined it will use the item_ind 
to set it manually

-Drain Energy(amount:float) this will return a float it just subtracts from energy value and emits two signals
EnergyChanged all the time (could be for energy bars above the object) or EnergyOut emitted when the object runs 
out of energy (could be for score or some other stuff idrk just nice to have).

--Energy Out--
-If respawn is not turned on the object deletes its self however if its not it disables collision 
turns invisible and re-enables after respawn time is out and selects a new object ( if not manually set )
------------

--Data Resource-- 
-create new data but right clicking and finding it in resources 
-assign two values [sprite_frames] and [Energy]
-add to list of possible items in MagicItem Scene
